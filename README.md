# Lucija Kovaƒç - Data analyst portfolio
### About me
Hi, I'm Lucija. I'm MScs in Mathematics (Aarhus University, DK). I have always been interested in data. Being able to make sense of something unconnected a first glance is a valuable skill.

This portfolio is my "Hello world" to the data community. I will try to cover as many different projects and get some fun and interesting results.

I'm open to any comments and criticisms. I would appreciate them. It would help me become better and improve my projects. I have planned to make several projects and I am going to upload them as they are ready, as well as update the existing ones. All comments and critiques are welcome and encouraged.

### Projects
