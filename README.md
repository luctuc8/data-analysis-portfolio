# Lucija Kovač - Data analyst portfolio
### About me
Hi, I'm Lucija. I'm MScs in Mathematics (Aarhus University, DK). I have always been interested in data. Being able to make sense of something unconnected a first glance is a valuable skill.

This portfolio is my "Hello world" to the data community. I will try to cover as many different projects and get some fun and interesting results.

I'm open to any comments and criticisms. I would appreciate them. It would help me become better and improve my projects. I have planned to make several projects and I am going to upload them as they are ready, as well as update the existing ones. All comments and critiques are welcome and encouraged.

### Projects

#### Machine learning
-[Salary prediction - classification](https://github.com/luctuc8/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Salary%20prediction%20-%20classification.ipynb)

Data consists of 32561 entries with 15 columns. I carried out the data cleaning by handling the unwanted inputs, checking the data types, outliers analysis and removing the unnecessary columns. Basic analysis and visualizations for the features I consider necessary was made.
In the end, I trained and made predictions of the data on 5 different classification machine learning models and compared their performance.

Skills: machine learning, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis

Technology: Python, pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statistics

#### Visualization
- [Gender Pay Gap](https://github.com/luctuc8/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Gender%20gap%20pay.ipynb)

Data consists of 1000 entries and 9 columns including JobTitle, Gender, Age, Performance evaluation, education, department, seniority, Base pay and Bonus.
The dataset was quite clean, but the necessary steps for cleaning were performed to assure that.

Skills: data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Matplotlib
