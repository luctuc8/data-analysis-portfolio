# Lucija Kovaƒç - Data analyst portfolio
### About me
Hi, I'm Lucija. I'm MScs in Mathematics (Aarhus University, DK). I have always been interested in data. Being able to make sense of something unconnected by a first glance is a valuable skill.

This portfolio is my "Hello world" to the data community. I will try to cover as many different projects and get some fun and interesting results. 

I'm open for any comments and criticisms. Actually, I would appriciate them. It would help me become better and improve my projects.

### Projects

- Gender pay gap
