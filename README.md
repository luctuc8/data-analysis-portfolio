# Lucija Kovač - Data portfolio
### 👩‍🔬 About me
Hi, I'm Lucija. I'm MScs in Mathematics (Aarhus University, DK). I have always been interested in data. Being able to make sense of something unconnected a first glance is a valuable skill.

This portfolio was created to enhance my resume and make me visible in the business world. It's my "Helo world" to the data community.

### 📓 Projects

#### 💻 Machine learning
- [Salary prediction - classification](https://github.com/luctuc8/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Salary%20prediction%20-%20classification.ipynb)

Data consists of 32561 entries with 15 columns. I carried out the data cleaning by handling the unwanted inputs, checking the data types, outliers analysis and removing the unnecessary columns. Basic analysis and visualizations for the features I consider necessary was made.
In the end, I trained and made predictions of the data on 5 different classification machine learning models and compared their performance.

Skills: machine learning, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis

Technology: Python, pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statistics

#### 📈 Visualization
- [Gender Pay Gap](https://github.com/luctuc8/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Gender%20gap%20pay.ipynb)

Data consists of 1000 entries and 9 columns including JobTitle, Gender, Age, Performance evaluation, education, department, seniority, Base pay and Bonus.
The dataset was quite clean, but the necessary steps for cleaning were performed to assure that.

Skills: data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scipy Stats
